How to Setup a Minecraft: Java Edition Server
Note: This guide shows you how to set up and configure a Minecraft Server. However, doing this requires changing your home network's configuration and is not recommended unless you know what you are doing. If you wish to purchase a small private server for friends, check out Minecraft Realms. If you still wish to set up your own private server, do so at your own risk as we cannot offer support for home networks or privately made servers. 

Here is a guide to help you create a server so your friends can join and play together!  

As a prerequisite, you should make sure you have Java installed and up to date on the computer that will host the server so it can run .jar files. 

Go to this website and download the minecraft_server.1.XX.X.jar file (The X’s will be the current version number) 
After you have downloaded it, make a folder on your desktop to keep all your server files in. You can name it “Minecraft Server”. 
Drag over or copy and paste the .jar file into the Minecraft Server folder. 
While you have the file browser open, open command prompt from the start menu.  
You can check if Java is installed in command prompt by typing without quotes “java -version”. 
To start the server, you will need to change the directory to the location where you have the Minecraft Server folder and the .jar file located in it. 
You can find the directory in Windows by simply clicking on the browser directory in file browser here. blobid0.png(The theme and color of your file browser will appear different due to your personalization settings) 
Copy this address to your clipboard. 
Type without quotes “cd” hit space and then paste the address you just copied, then hit enter. 
This should look like “cd C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Minecraft Server”
